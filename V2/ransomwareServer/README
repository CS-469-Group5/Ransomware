Server must have cert.crt and priv.pem file to run. These are generated using generateKey from generateCerts directory or copied over from me. Password is "1234" for mine.
Once these are created the server can be ran using "python server.py 0.0.0.0". It will wait for responses from clients and recieve encryption keys and client
IDs from them. Once recieved, it will create a file that is unique to each client. Client ID is a 128bit random number using pythons UUID library.
